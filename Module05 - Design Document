Components
1) Data Collection Module

      -Purpose: Collects real-time and historical sports data.

      -Technologies: APIs from sports data providers like Sportsradar or ESPN.

2) Data Processing Engine

      -Purpose: Processes and analyzes collected data to identify trends and probabilities.

      -Technologies: Python, Pandas for data manipulation.

3) Prediction Model

      -Purpose: Uses statistical models to predict the outcomes of various prop bets.

      -Technologies: Python, SciPy for statistical analysis, Machine Learning models.

4) User Interface

      -Purpose: Allows users to interact with the system, view predictions, and manage their bets.

      -Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for web interface; React for dynamic components.

5) Database

      -Purpose: Stores user data, historical results, and betting odds.

      -Technologies: MySQL or MongoDB.




Data Structures

      -Arrays and Lists: To store lists of data like team stats, player performance records, etc.

      -Hash Tables: To quickly access player or team information based on unique identifiers.

      -Trees (Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees): For sorted data operations, especially useful in quickly finding odds and historical data ranges.

      -Graphs: To model relationships and performance impacts between different players or teams.




Component Interactions
    -Data Collection to Data Processing:

      -Data collected via APIs is sent to the Data Processing Engine in the form of JSON or XML structures.

      -The Processing Engine cleans and structures this data into usable formats (arrays, tables).

  -Data Processing to Prediction Model:

      -Processed data is fed into the Prediction Model to update the predictive analytics based on the latest data.

      -The model recalculates probabilities and updates its outputs.

    -Prediction Model to User Interface:

      -Predictive results are sent to the User Interface to be displayed to the user.

      -Users can interact with this data by placing bets or modifying their betting strategies.

    -User Interface to Database:

      -User preferences, historical queries, and bet logs are stored in the Database.

      -The database sends historical data back to the Data Processing Engine as needed for comparative analysis.





  Testing Strategy
  -Unit Testing: Each module will be tested individually for functionality and reliability.

  -Integration Testing: Testing how well the different modules interact with each other.

  -System Testing: Testing the complete system on a staging server to simulate real-world usage conditions.

  -Performance Testing: To ensure the system can handle the load during high-traffic times, especially during major sports events.





Security Measures
  -Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive user data and communications between client-server using SSL/TLS.

  -User Authentication: Implement OAuth for secure user login and data access.

  -Error Handling: Robust error handling to prevent crashes and unauthorized data access.






Implementation Plan
    -Phase 1: Prototype Development (Month 1-2)

          -Development of Data Collection and Processing Modules.

          -Initial setup of Database and User Interface.

    -Phase 2: Model Integration and Initial Testing (Month 3-4)

        -Integration of the Prediction Model.

        -Begin unit and integration testing.

    -Phase 3: User Testing and Feedback (Month 5-6)

      -Deploy beta version to select users.

      -Collect user feedback and adjust the system accordingly.

Launch: Targeted for Month 7, before the start of the football season.
