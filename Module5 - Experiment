Arrays or lists can be used for storing lists of bets, results, or game data in a sequential manner, which is useful for situations where you need to access elements in a sequential order or by index.

Example Usage: Storing game results

java
Copy
List<String> gameResults = new ArrayList<>();
gameResults.add("Team A 3-1 Team B");
gameResults.add("Team C 2-2 Team D");

// Accessing a specific game's result
String result = gameResults.get(1);  // "Team C 2-2 Team D"


HashMaps are ideal for quickly accessing player or game statistics without the need to search through lists. Key-value pairs in HashMaps can efficiently handle mappings like player names to their stats.

Example Usage: Mapping player names to scores

java
Copy
Map<String, Integer> playerScores = new HashMap<>();
playerScores.put("John Doe", 15);
playerScores.put("Jane Smith", 20);

// Accessing a player's score
int score = playerScores.get("Jane Smith");  // 20

A queue could be used to manage real-time data or actions, such as a queue of bets that need to be processed or a queue of events coming in during live games.

Example Usage: Queue of live game events

java
Copy
Queue<String> liveEvents = new LinkedList<>();
liveEvents.offer("Goal by Team A");
liveEvents.offer("Penalty for Team B");

// Processing an event
String event = liveEvents.poll();  // "Goal by Team A"

For organizing bets or games by priority, such as odds or potential payout, a priority queue can ensure that you are always processing the most significant item next.

Example Usage: Bets with highest potential payout

java
Copy
PriorityQueue<Bet> betQueue = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparing(Bet::getPayout).reversed());

betQueue.offer(new Bet("Bet 1", 100));
betQueue.offer(new Bet("Bet 2", 150));

// Retrieving the bet with the highest payout
Bet highestPayoutBet = betQueue.poll();  // Bet 2 with $150 payout

Binary Search Trees (BST) can be useful for storing sorted data, such as rankings or sorted lists of player statistics, which allows for quick lookups, insertions, and deletions.

Example Usage: Storing and accessing player rankings

java
Copy
class Player implements Comparable<Player> {
    String name;
    int score;

    public Player(String name, int score) {
        this.name = name;
        this.score = score;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Player other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.score, other.score);
    }
}

TreeSet<Player> playerRankings = new TreeSet<>();
playerRankings.add(new Player("John Doe", 900));
playerRankings.add(new Player("Jane Smith", 950));

// Retrieving the highest score
Player highestRanked = playerRankings.last();  // Jane Smith with 950 points
